# teachMe

###### Currently this is the main project I'm working on. WIP

WIP => A platform that will facilitate meeting in person and teaching other people.

#### Star repo for updates.

Tech stack used:

- React
- Firebase
- Redux (will get added)
- SCSS

Design inspiration taken from dribbble.com.
I want this to be a PWA, so working towards that.

### I update my progress through [issues](https://github.com/sorinpav/teachme/issues) on this repo.

#### This project's workflow is based on 2 main branches, master and development.

Feature branches as also present for separate issues, but I'm currently working alone on the project, so not coordinating with anyone yet. Therefore, feature development may happen sometimes on the development branch directly. Welcoming collaborations in the future, and we will coordinate based on the workflow decribed above.

### To be updated with more features.
