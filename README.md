# teachme

A platform that will facilitate meeting in person and teaching other people.

Currently it's WIP.

Tech stack used:

- React
- Firebase
- More to be confirmed.

Project idea in detail:

TeachME idea ⇒ Find instructors in your area and meetup ⇒ Instructors get to organise meetups with multiple people and teach together ⇒ split on cities / regions

⇒ Platform gives people discounts on venues to book to meetup ⇒ venues get to advertise on platform ⇒ this is part of the business model

Add online meetup alternative on platform, for cases of Covid and global pandemic.
