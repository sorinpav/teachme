# teachme

###### Currently this is the main project I'm working on. WIP

A platform that will facilitate meeting in person and teaching other people.

Currently it's WIP.

Tech stack used:

- React
- Firebase
- Redux (will get added)

Design inspiration taken from dribbble.com.
I want this to be a PWA, so working towards that. I update my progress through issues on this repo.

### To be updated with more features.
